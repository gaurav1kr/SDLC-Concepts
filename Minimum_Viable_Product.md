# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

A **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** is the most basic version of a product that includes only the **core features** necessary to address the primary needs of its target audience. It is developed with minimal effort and cost to test the product's viability in the market.

## Key Characteristics of an MVP:
1. **Core Functionality**: Focuses on delivering the main value proposition.
2. **Low Development Cost and Time**: Avoids additional features that aren't essential for early-stage testing.
3. **Customer Feedback**: Built to gather feedback from early users to iterate and improve the product.
4. **Testing Market Fit**: Helps assess demand, usability, and market potential before committing to full-scale development.

3. **Amazon**: Began as an online bookstore with just a simple website showcasing available books.
